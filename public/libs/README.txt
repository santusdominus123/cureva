To use the full functionality of the 3D viewer, you need to download the external libraries from:
https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer/releases/latest

Download the release archive and extract the 'libs' folder contents to this directory.

The libs folder should contain:
- External format libraries
- Environment maps
- Other required dependencies

Without these libraries, some 3D file formats may not load properly.
